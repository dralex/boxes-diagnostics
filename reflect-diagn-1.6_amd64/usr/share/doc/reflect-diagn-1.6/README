Build instructions
------------------

Qt 4.3+ library is required to build this application. The application was
tested on Linux and Windows (XP SP3 or higher), probably MacOS X version
could be built without problems.

1) To build Russian version of the application just run:

$ qmake
$ make

If you use Linux, you need config.ini to be installed to /etc/reflect-diagn:

# mkdir /etc/reflect-diagn
# cp config.ini /etc/reflect-diagn/

You also need to specify the path for books.txt file (or just place it in the
same directory as executable.

2) To build English version of the application you have to modify diagn.pro
file and remove comment at the line DEFINES += DIAGN_ENGLISH. After that
you are able to build program:

$ qmake
$ make

If you use Linux, you need config-en.ini to be installed to /etc/reflect-diagn:

# mkdir /etc/reflect-diagn
# cp config-en.ini /etc/reflect-diagn/config.ini

You also need to specify the path for books-en.txt file (or just place it in
the same directory as executable.
